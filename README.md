# **Adaptive Signal Processing and Machine Intelligence (ASPMI) Coursework**

All the code used to perform the relevant computations and plot the relevant data visualisations are logically and intuitively organised in the *Code* directory. The *ASPMI_Report_01517322.pdf* document presents the results of the conducted analyses, clearly explaining the reasoning behind the observations, and why certain actions had to be taken to achieve a set goal. This coursework has been completed by following the tasks outlined in the *Tasks.pdf* document. These tasks guided the structure of the analyses and are reflected in the code and report.

 ## **Work Summary**

*	Applied machine learning for spectrum estimation and analysis of real-world data (EEG, sunspot time series) using advanced parametric models and periodograms.
*	Conducted time-series analysis on biological signals, utilising autoregressive (AR) modelling and power spectral density (PSD) estimation to enhance predictive capabilities.
*	Developed robust Principal Component Regression (PCR) models to handle noisy, multicollinear datasets, and compared performance with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) using MATLAB.
*	Implemented and optimised the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm for adaptive noise cancellation, showcasing proficiency in real-time data filtering and signal processing.
