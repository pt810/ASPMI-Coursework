# **Adaptive Signal Processing and Machine Intelligence (ASPMI) Coursework**

All the code used to perform the relevant computations and plot the relevant data visualisations are logically and intuitively organised in the *Code* directory. The *ASPMI_Report_01517322.pdf* document presents the results of the analysis conducted, clearly explaining the reasoning behind the observations, and why certain actions had to be taken to achieve a set goal. This coursework has been completed by following the tasks outlined in the *Tasks.pdf* document.
